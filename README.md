# Jazzle
The frontend for Jazzle, a Wordle-clone for jazz standard identification. I wanted to brush up on my web skills and try explore using some new tools such as Hyperscript (https://hyperscript.org/), HTMX (https://htmx.org/), and docker + flask. 

The main philosophy behind HTMX and Hyperscript from what I can tell is to localize behavior; implementation should be as local as possible to make code as readable and understandable as possible.
