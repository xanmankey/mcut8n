# TODO

- [x] Home page
- [x] Events/event interactions/resources
- [ ] Figure out what to do about the thumbs up; I want each thumbs-up to be a rating score and I want to use sessions to persist rating data... I think I need to use a database for persistence because sessions can be cleared and I'll just relate it to the user somehow (I'll just have a pop-up to check it against username)
- [ ] Get db functionality working
- [ ] Ensure that individual events load correctly
- [] Make the grids load from jinja, add code for uploading files
- [] Start designing events
- [] Host on RasPi
- [] Once the websites mostly done see if someone wants to make a logo?

## GOAL

- Design and develop the website in a speedy manner
- Make it simple/fairly professional
- Figure out a way to get it hosted 24/7 on the RasPi
